# fashion_supply-resource_management
This projectâ€™s interface is designed in such a way that it creates a streamlined process for the supply and resource management for fashion designers, keeping their concerns into consideration. This solves problems of sustainability in fashion as well as recycling and reusing fashion scrap generated by designers.
